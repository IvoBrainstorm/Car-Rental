# Car-Rental

This mini project was developed to solve a series of exercises, as a way to practice JAVA in my free times (Not that free has it seems)...

## I solved this issue:

A car rental company charges an hourly rate for rentals up to 12 hours. However, if the rental period exceeds 12 hours, the rental will be charged based on a daily amount. In addition to the lease price, it is added to the price the tax value according to country rules which, in the case of Mozambique, is 20% for values up to 100.00, or 15% for values above 100.00. Make a program that reads the location data (car model, start and end time of the lease), as well as the hourly rate and daily rental amount. The program must then generate the payment invoice (containing the rental amount, tax and total payment amount) and enter the data on the screen.
